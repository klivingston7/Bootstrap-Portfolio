          <p>
            I was born and raised in La Jolla, California and lived there for the greater part of 18 years until I wanted to experience something completely different and moved to the great state of Texas. 
            I chose to attend Texas Christian University where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Geoscience. 
            I also played football for TCU as a preferred walk-on for three years where I was fortunate to be apart of two BCS bowl games including a memorable win over Wisconsin in the 97th Rose Bowl.
          </p>

            I enjoy playing sports, the outdoors, and traveling; whether it be for business or pleasure. 
            I am a very personable and easy going individual who enjoys networking and building relationships with co-workers and potential clients alike.
